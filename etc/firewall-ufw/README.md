Uncomplicated FireWall application preset
===================
Installation
-----------
**Please note:** When you installed syncthing using the official deb package, you can skip the copying.

Copy the file `syncthing` to your ufw applications directory usually located at `/etc/ufw/applications.d/`. (root permissions required).

In a terminal run
```
sudo ufw app update syncthing
```
to load the preset.
To allow the syncthing ports, run
```
sudo ufw allow syncthing
```
You can then verify the opened ports
```
sudo ufw status verbose
```
