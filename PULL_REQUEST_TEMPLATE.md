### Authorship

Every author of a code contribution (Go, Javascript, HTML, CSS etc, with the
possible exception of minor typo corrections and similar) is recorded in the
AUTHORS and NICKS files and the in-GUI credits. If this is your first
contribution, a maintainer will add you properly before accepting the
contribution. You need not do so yourself or worry about the fact that the
"authors" automated test fails. However, if your name (such as you want it
presented in the credits) is not visible on your Github profile or in your
commit messages, please assist by providing it here.
