<!--
### Does your log mention database corruption?

If your Syncthing log reports panics because of database corruption it is
most likely a fault with your system's storage or memory. Affected log
entries will contain lines starting with `panic: leveldb`. You will need to
delete the index database to clear this, by running `syncthing
-reset-database`.
