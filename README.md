syncthing
=========

This is the `syncthing` project. The following are the project goals:

 1. Define a protocol for synchronization of a file repository between a
    number of collaborating nodes. The protocol should be well defined,
    unambiguous, easily understood, free to use, efficient, secure and
    language neutral. This is the [Block Exchange
    Protocol](https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/blob/master/protocol/PROTOCOL.md).

 2. Provide the reference implementation to demonstrate the usability of
    said protocol. This is the `syncthing` utility. It is the hope that
    alternative, compatible implementations of the protocol will come to
    exist.

The two are evolving together; the protocol is not to be considered
stable until syncthing 1.0 is released, at which point it is locked down
for incompatible changes.

Syncthing does not use the BitTorrent protocol. The reasons for this are:

 1. We don't know if BitTorrent Sync does either, so there's nothing to
    be compatible with.

 2. BitTorrent includes a lot of functionality for 
    making sure large swarms of selfish agents behave and somehow work
    towards a common goal. Here we have a much smaller swarm of cooperative
    agents and a simpler approach will suffice.
